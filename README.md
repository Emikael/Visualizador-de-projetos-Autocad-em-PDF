Aplicação desktop desenvolvida em JavaScript. Utilizando o framework [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). Electron é um framework que permite que você escreve uma aplicação multiplataforma usando JavaScript, HTML e CSS. É baseada em [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) e [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/).

=======
**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
